## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

## WhatsApp Notifications (Approval)

This project can notify applicants via WhatsApp when an admin approves a permohonan (application) using the WhatsApp Cloud API.

Setup:

1. Create a WhatsApp Business App and get:
	- Permanent Access Token
	- Phone Number ID
2. Add these to your `.env`:

```
WHATSAPP_ENABLED=true
WHATSAPP_TOKEN="<your-permanent-access-token>"
WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID="<your-phone-number-id>"
```

Notes:
- Phone numbers should be in international format. Indonesian numbers like `08xxxxxxxxxx` will be normalized to `628xxxxxxxxxx` automatically.
- Messages are sent synchronously when status changes to `approved`. If you prefer queueing, wire the `WhatsAppService::sendMessage` call into a queued Job.
- Links in the message point to the applicant detail and print pages. Ensure `APP_URL` is correctly set in `.env` so URLs are absolute.

Security:
- If `WHATSAPP_ENABLED` is false or credentials are missing, the app will skip sending and log a warning.
